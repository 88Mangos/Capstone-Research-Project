- ISIC 2016: Download Task 3 Training and Test Data.
- ISIC 2017: Download Training, Validation, and Test Data. Make sure to remove duplicates of images already in ISIC 2016.
- DDI: Download all images.

In *datasets*, the original images for DDI and ISIC are not included because it would make the repository too large. For example, the ISIC folder including the original images is over 11 GB.
